# 3 Systen Configuration

## 3.1 enable nat on iptables
```
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```
## 3.2 Auto Start Container
Set the container to start automatically when the LXC service starts â€“ usually at host boot time. Use 1 to enable and 0 to disable.
```
lxc config set [CONTAINER_NAME] boot.autostart 1
```

You can also use boot.autostart.delay to set a delay in seconds after starting this container, before starting the next.
```

```
## 3.4 Container Auto start order
Start up can be ordered using lxc.autostart.order to prioritise which containers are started first. Higher numbers are started first.
```

lxc config set [CONTAINER_NAME_2] boot.autostart.order 8
```
